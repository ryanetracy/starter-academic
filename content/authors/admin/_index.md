I am a 3rd year PhD Student in the Basic and Applied Social Psychology program at the City University of New York. Working with <a href = "https://cunybasp.org/faculty#young">Dr. Steven Young</a> in the <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/scamplab/home?authuser=2">Social Cognition and Motivated Perception Lab</a>, I explore how people make sense of their social worlds. In this line of research, I study how top-down, motivated social cognitions interact with bottom-up perceptual cues in a person's face in the service of impression formation. Additionally, I look at how the perceptual clarity of visual field information impacts face perception and explore how people mentally represent specific traits and social group memberships in a person's face.
